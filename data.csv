Mr. Clarke— Having recently visited that place, I can inform the house of ihe awful state in which the inhabitants of Martinique are now placed I can better describe it by saying that it is the opinion of several gentlemen who accompanied me there,, that Fort Royal now presents much the appearance that Bridgetown did the morning after the hurricane of the 11th August, 31. From the most accurate accounts we @¢ould obtain, there were only 28 wooden houses remaining out of the number which vance composed thatcity—the others must either be taken down, or partially rebuilt— the Hospital and Government Offices are all to- tally destroyed, and in every street of the town you may force your arm through the fissures of the walls yet standing. The relief will, therefore, be most seasonable, and I know of no Colony more entitled to our	1839-03-09	18390309_AA00047511_02174	hurricane*	1839 Martinique Earthquake|Great Barbados Hurricane	1839-01-11	Fort Royal, Martinique	14.64437087	-61.07016855

For more than a week past the appearance of the weather had induced a belief in the minds of the most experienced individuals, that a hurricane was about to visit us, and the conviction drawn from these appearances was greatly strengthened, by the almost deafening roar of the sea to the Southward on the night of Tuesday last.
